\title{Function to Identify Network Regulators from Undirected Networks}
\usage{
regulatorAnalysis.undirected(adj, G, h = 3, FDR = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj}{Required. An n x n weighted upper triangular adjacency in the matrix 
class format.}

\item{G}{Required. A named vector of node scores.}

\item{h}{Optional. Neighborhood search distance (h nodes away from current node) 
(Default = 3)}

\item{FDR}{Optional. Adjusted pvalue cutoff for regulator selection.
(Default = 0.05)}
}
\value{
scores = n x 3 dimensional list with columns giving neighborhood
based score, adjusted pvalue, whether a gene is regulator/global regulator.
}
