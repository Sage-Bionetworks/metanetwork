\title{Simulate Network Data}
\usage{
simulateNetworkData(n, p, prop, adjustment = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Required. The number of rows to simulate in the data. These correspond 
to the number of simulated samples}

\item{p}{Required. The number of columns to simulate in the data. These correspond 
to the number of gene features}

\item{prop}{Required. a value between 0 and 1, corresponding the probability
value in the `rbinom()` adjustment of expression values.}

\item{adjustment}{Optional. A matrix, vector, or 1D array, or missing. This
corresponds to the x vaule in the `diag()` adjustment of the inverse covariance
matrix. (Default = 10)}
}
\value{
A list containing a simulated network and the inverse covariance matrix
of the simulated network.s
}
\description{
This function simulates a gene correlation network and inverse covariance matrix
of user determined size.
