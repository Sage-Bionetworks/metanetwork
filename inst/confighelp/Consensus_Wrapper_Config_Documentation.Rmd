A [configuration file](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/metanetwork/blob/master/inst/config/network-consensus/microglial_consensus.yml) defines the inputs for the Consensus Network Wrapper workflow. Update the default parameters to include the Synapse ID where your data is stored and the appropriate annotation data you want to use for storage of the produced consensus network. The full list of configurable options are:

```
default:
  input_profile:
    input_folderid:         Required. A character vector of a synapse ID of a 
                            synapse project/folder that consists of all the 
                            individual network folders names with a pattern or
                            just the method name.
    project_id:             Required. The synapse output folder where the 
                            consensus network is stored.
    input_proj_id:          Required. The original input data matrix used to prepare
                            the individual networks themselves, such as 
                            RNAseq data or microarray data.
    is_csv:                 Optional. A logical TRUE/FALSE value specifying if the 
                            original input data matrix used to prepare the individual 
                            networks is a csv (TRUE), or tab delimited file with 
                            the rownames as the first column (FALSE).
                            (Default is TRUE)
    temp_storage_loc:       Required.
    temp_input_loc:         Required.
    pattern_id:             Required. A character vector too match the file names 
                            associated to the children entities in project_id.
                            eg( _Network)
    run_id:                 Required. A character vector too match in the children 
                            entities in project_id. This may or may not be the same 
                            as `pattern_id` depending on your network construction 
                            parameters. (eg. Network') 
  provenance:               **Annotations** rovenance annoation subsections - 
                            can be obtained from the parent syn ID. More details 
                            about obtaining annotations from synapse can be found 
                            [here](https://help.synapse.org/docs/Annotations-and-Queries.2011070649.html).
                            More details on the functioning of Provenance can be 
                            found [here](https://help.synapse.org/docs/Provenance.1972470373.html) 
                            A sample annotation profile includes the following required
